I also felt like Unity might have been overkill for such a project, plus, this is cool, and I wanted to see if I could create something useful with my newfound skills.</p>",
                "<p>After working on this for a few days, time was running up before I had to demo this, so I decided to simplify a bit, and base it a little more off of Red Blob's <a href='https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/'>Making Maps with Noise Functions blog</a> instead. This is the one I was more familiar with. I did get quite far with the polygons: the mesh is actually created from polygons still, which is triangulated so it can be rendered with WebGL. The height and moisture maps are still created using noise (thank you Auburn for <a href='https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite'>FastNoiseLite</a>, it is amazing.) However, I believe it turned out quite well.</p>",

Some of the things implemented in that were chunk loading, asset (text) loading, general user interfaces, djikstra's algorithm for the enemies, as well as a combat system.

                "<p>For designing the game, I didn't put too much thought into it. Most of that was due to the time constraint. The idea was that I was going to create a Mario clone, but with Sage as the main character. And, since Sage is the main character, then I must be the one in peril. I thought it was a fun take on the whole thing. The boss of the game, of course, had to be somebody who wants to take me from her- so, I made it my friend Devin. You can see them in the main menu screenshot. ;)</p>",
